<b>Can SARS-CoV-2 infect a patient more than once?</b><br>\
\
Corona viruses are not new, as a result there has been at least some research on them. Research suggests that coronaviruses are protein-stable, i.e. they do not alter their surface proteins easily. In light of this, the more likely explanation for the reinfection claims is that the tests that were done during discharge were false-negatives. When a person gets better, the number of viruses go down slowly, but they do not go to zero right away. During this time testing might be less reliable and the symptoms can later worsen.\
