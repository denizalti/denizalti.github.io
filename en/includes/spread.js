<b>How does SARS-CoV-2 spread?</b><br>\
SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, like other corona viruses. These viruses use the respiratory secretions to spread. The viruses are primarily shed through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. But depending on the person viruses can be shed even while speaking: The letter P is enough to shed hundreds of thousands of viruses. We create aerosols when we talk, cough, sneeze and the virus travels in the aerosol. SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to be able to travel 1-8 feet, depending on aerosol droplet size. Having said that, airborne spread has not been reported for COVID-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence.\
\
Once on a surface, SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus can survive up to 3 days, depending on the surface:\

There are four things to note in this study:\
<ol>\
  <li>The study is done by counting the number of viruses on given surfaces. It is very important to know that not every virus that is seen on a surface is able to infect cells. The ratio depends on the virus, and can be as high as 1/1 (Semliki Forest Virus) or as low as 1/1000 (Polio Virus).</li>\
  <li>As shown, the number of viruses that are visible decrease over time. So on day 2 there is much fewer viruses on a given surface than on day 1.</li>\
  <li>The aerosols data is collected by counting the number of viruses that stay present in a 40 L Goldberg drum used for aerosol survival studies. This is an isolated air drum, and is different from the environments people might get exposed to the aerosols.</li>\
  <li>Lastly, a person needs to be exposed to thousands of viruses to be infected. Data so far suggests that this might be more likely through touch. So it is very important to wash your hands thoroughly and frequently.</li>\
