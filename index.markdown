I'm a Software Engineer and a Tech Lead in the Infrastructure team at <font face="futura"><font color="#4885ed">G</font><font color="#db3236">o</font><font color="#f4c20d">o</font><font color="#4885ed">g</font><font color="#3cba54">l</font><font color="#db3236">e</font></font>.
My work is focused on building huge-scale distributed systems.
I focus on designing and implementing distributed systems that balance strong
features and simplicity with scalability, reliability, and efficiency.
In my work I constantly push to improve the state-of-the-art to deal with the
challenges of building ever-evolving systems. Sometimes this means focusing on
supporting new features with minimal changes to the system design, sometimes it
means employing Machine Learning as a crucial component in the system, and
sometimes it means working on a clean-slate design to build the next iteration
of a given system.

As a Tech Lead, I focus on enabling hard to execute projects and supporting
people while they do what they are best at.

Prior to joining <font face="futura"><font color="#4885ed">G</font><font color="#db3236">o</font><font color="#f4c20d">o</font><font color="#4885ed">g</font><font color="#3cba54">l</font><font color="#db3236">e</font></font> I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University.
During my Ph.D. I focused on building Distributed Systems that rely on strong
foundations in Distributed Systems Theory. I specialized in consensus protocols
([Paxos Made Moderately Complex](http://paxos.systems/), Chain Replication), replication (OpenReplica)
and evolving systems (Transformations).

In addition to my technical work, I serve as a [PC member]({{ site.baseurl }}/conference/)
in Distributed Systems and DEI Conferences, mentor students and junior engineers,
give [talks/guest lectures]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks/), and volunteer to spread
the idea that there are many different ways to excel at what you do.
