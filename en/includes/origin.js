<b>Where did SARS-CoV-2 originate from? How is SARS-CoV-2 (2019) different than SARS-CoV (2003)?</b><br>\
SARS-CoV-2 is genomically very similar to SARS-CoV virus that caused the SARS epidemic in 2003 and it is the seventh member of the coronaviruses known to infect humans. It is not a laboratory construct nor a purposefully manipulated virus. You can see the genomic comparison to SARS-CoV below (as well as  other coronaviruses that infect bats):\

The high-level difference is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads easier and quicker than SARS-CoV. This makes so much sense from an evolutionary perspective: the selective force for viruses is to infect more hosts. This means that the versions of the coronaviruses that become better at infecting hosts and also using these hosts to infect others get selected over generations. SARS-CoV-2 has a longer incubation period where the hosts do not show symptoms but still shed the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is also not as deadly, so the host can live longer to host the virus and infect more people.\
