<b>Can SARS-CoV-2 mutate and become more dangerous?</b><br>\
While talking about viruses and mutations, it is important to understand a couple of things:\
<ol>\
<li> Viruses mutate continuously. They need to mutate to survive. These individual mutations are small and do not necessarily mean our immune system will not be able to defeat the virus if it learned to defeat it once. SARS-CoV-2 has mutated many times since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2019. You can see all the mutations on a map <a href='https://nextstrain.org/ncov'>here</a>.\

\
</li>\
<li> Having said that, these small mutations add up and through the selective force of evolution, some viruses will be able to change their surface proteins and look like a new virus to our immune system, in effect escaping immunity.</li>\
<li> As detailed above, viruses are not selected for deadliness, they are selected for infectiousness. So they generally become less virulent over time. This is a common thing that happens in RNA viruses such as flu and corona viruses. This means when SARS-CoV-2 mutates to escape immunity, it is more likely to evolve into more infectious but less deadly versions.\
