I'm a Software Engineer and a Tech Lead in the Infrastructure team at <font face="futura"><font color="#4885ed">G</font><font color="#db3236">o</font><font color="#f4c20d">o</font><font color="#4885ed">g</font><font color="#3cba54">l</font><font color="#db3236">e</font></font>.
My work is focused on building huge-scale distributed systems.
I focus on designing and implementing distributed systems that balance strong
features and simplicity with scalability, reliability, and efficiency.
In my work I constantly push to improve the state-of-the-art to deal with the
challenges of building ever-evolving systems. Sometimes this means focusing on
supporting new features with minimal changes to the system design, sometimes it
means [employing Machine Learning as a crucial component in the system](http://mlforsystems.org/assets/papers/neurips2020/learned_abu-libdeh_2020.pdf), and
sometimes it means working on a clean-slate design to build the next iteration
of a given system.

As a Tech Lead, I focus on enabling hard to execute projects and supporting
people while they do what they are best at.

Prior to joining <font face="futura"><font color="#4885ed">G</font><font color="#db3236">o</font><font color="#f4c20d">o</font><font color="#4885ed">g</font><font color="#3cba54">l</font><font color="#db3236">e</font></font> I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University.
During my Ph.D. I focused on building Distributed Systems that rely on strong
foundations in Distributed Systems Theory. I specialized in consensus protocols
([Paxos Made Moderately Complex](http://paxos.systems/)), replication
([Chain Replication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hDjkV4iFzs), [OpenReplica](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/29009/OpenReplica.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y))
and evolving systems ([Ovid/Transformations](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotcloud16/hotcloud16_altinbuken.pdf)).

In addition to my technical work, I serve as a [PC member]({{ site.baseurl }}/conference/)
in Distributed Systems and DEI Conferences, mentor students and junior engineers,
give [talks/guest lectures]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks/).
