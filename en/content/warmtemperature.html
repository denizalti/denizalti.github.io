<b>Will warmer temperatures eradicate the virus?</b><br>
  Temperature and humidity play a role in the transmission of the virus. High temperatures inactivate the virus on surfaces much quicker. High humidity lowers the travel length of the droplets. But in hot and humid climates there are still viral infections, including the flu. So the warmer temperatures will lower the spread a little bit, but lack of global immunity will still be overriding the effects of temperature. This is also evident by the spread in both hemispheres:
