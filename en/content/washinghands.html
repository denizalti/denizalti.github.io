<b>Is washing hands better than using hand sanitizer?</b><br>
  Yes, is the short answer. Washing your hands with soap for 30 seconds is better than using a hand sanitizer because if you do not use a generous amount hand sanitizer evaporates quickly, probably before you can clean all the surfaces on your hand to inactivate all the viruses. If you do not have access to soap and water, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
